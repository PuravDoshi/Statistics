# 📊 Descriptive Statistics Analysis – Titanic Dataset

This project is a comprehensive exploration of **descriptive statistics** using the Titanic dataset. It focuses on developing a strong understanding of **univariate and bivariate analysis**, **summary statistics**, and **visual exploration** using Python.

All 26 questions below were answered using practical statistical techniques, Python code (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and visualizations.

## ✅ Dataset Used
- **Source**: [Titanic dataset (Kaggle / Seaborn)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Columns of interest**: `age`, `fare`, `sex`, `pclass`, `survived`, etc.

## 🧮 Questions Answered

### 📊 Univariate Analysis
1. What is the mean, median, and mode of the age column?  
2. What is the trimmed mean of fare, removing the top and bottom 10% of values?  
3. Calculate the weighted mean of fare, using pclass as the weight.  
4. What is the range, variance, standard deviation, and mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the age variable?  
5. Calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) for the fare column.  
6. What are the quantiles (25%, 50%, 75%) and percentiles (10th, 90th) of fare?  
7. Display the five-number summary of age.

### 📊 Frequency Tables & Cumulative Frequency
8. Create a frequency table for the sex column.  
9. Create a frequency and cumulative frequency table for pclass.  
10. Create a histogram of age and overlay the cumulative distribution.  

---

### 📊 Bivariate Analysis
11. Compute the covariance between age and fare.  
12. Compute the Pearson correlation between age and fare.  
13. Which pair of numerical columns have the highest positive and negative correlation?  

---

### 📊 Data Visualization
14. Create histograms of age and fare with KDE plots.  
15. Create a boxplot of fare across different pclass levels.  
16. Create a violin plot of age grouped by sex.  
17. Draw a scatter plot showing the relationship between age and fare.  
18. Create a pairplot of the numeric features to visualize all pairwise relationships.  

---

### 📊 Grouped Statistics (Advanced Practice)
19. What is the average age of survivors vs non-survivors?  
20. What is the median fare paid by each class (pclass)?  
21. Which group had more variability in age: males or females?  
22. What is the correlation between age and survival for each gender separately?  

---

### 📊 Bonus Questions (Open-Ended Insight)
23. Which variable shows the highest relative variation? Use Coefficient of Variation.  
24. Who paid the highest fare and what class were they in?  
25. Are higher fares associated with higher survival rates? Use a grouped correlation or boxplot.  
26. Which class had the lowest median age?
